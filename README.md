# LearningPytorch
Goal: Document learning progress in computer vision and machine learning using Pytorch Framework

Environment: Anaconda package manager was used to install CUDA 12.1 and Pytorch and their dependencies for Python. https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ offers a good starting guide on how to manage this environment.

Project 1:
The goal is to use CIFAR-10 image dataset to explore supervised deep learning for image classification. The CIFAR-10 dataset is of historical interest in the field of machine learning and has some great benchmarks to compare against. The original dataset collection is detailed in [Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/learning-features-2009-TR.pdf) , Alex Krizhevsky, 2009.
